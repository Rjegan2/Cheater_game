Go to the itch page to download a playable version of the game: https://rjegan2002.itch.io/cheater  
Unity version 2022.3.4f1 was used to make this game  
*Note: This Github is just so people can look at the code that was done for the game. If you try downloading these files and open the project on Unity, errors will pop up saying the scenes are corrupted. Something went wrong when I was pushing the files to this Github. The code itself for scripts are still perfectly intact
